# Optimizing Patient Wait Times: Analyzing Pre-Consultation Delays in Outpatient Hospital Operations

## Overview  
This repository contains a data analysis case study focused on understanding and optimizing patient wait times in an outpatient hospital setting. Using the [Hospital Patient Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulqaderasiirii/hospital-patient-data) dataset, we analyze the typical duration between `Entry Time` and `Post-Consultation Time` and identify potential bottlenecks in the pre-consultation process.

### Objectives  
1. **Measure Typical Wait Time**: Calculate the average duration patients wait before seeing a doctor.  
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Detect delays by time of day, doctor type, or patient volume to improve hospital efficiency.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [Hospital Patient Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulqaderasiirii/hospital-patient-data)  
- **Key Columns**: `Date`, `Entry Time`, `Post-Consultation Time`, `Completion Time`, `Doctor Type`, `Financial Class`, `Patient ID`.  
- **Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size/license constraints. Download it from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` folder as `hospital_patient_data.csv`.
